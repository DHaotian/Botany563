# Software:
1. IQ-TREE (Online version)
  Description: W-IQ-TREE is an intuitive and user-friendly web interface and server for IQ-TREE, an efficient phylogenetic software for maximum likelihood analysis.
  Strengths: IQ-TREE supports multiple sequence types (DNA, protein, codon, binary and morphology) in common alignment formats and a wide range of evolutionary models including mixture and partition models. 
             IQ-TREE performs fast model selection, partition scheme finding, efficient tree reconstruction, ultrafast bootstrapping, branch tests, and tree topology tests.
  Weaknesses: IQ-Tree isn’t guaranteed to find the best one
              Difficult to compare for computing time against other methods
              IQ-TREE with stopping rule improves performance, but can be slower than RAxML and PhyML, especially for AA alignments
  Assumption: sequences: 200-800 (DNA), 50-600 (AA)
              Alignment length: 4-2x #sequences
              Proportion of gaps/unknown characters: ≤70% 
              IQ-TREE1 → only unrooted trees | IQ-TREE2 → enables inference of rooted trees
